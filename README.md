# MLB-Stadiums

This is a dataset from a [Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paulrjohnson/mlb-ballparks) in which it describe the physical and environmental dimensions of 2022 season Major League Baseball (MLB) ballparks. The dimensions of these ballparks are often relevant on analysing or predicting outcomes of batters' performance.

I apply four different clustering methods and analyze the result of each and individual methods.
